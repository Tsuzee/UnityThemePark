# UnityThemePark
This was my final Project for Interactive Media Development. We were tasked with creating a unity scene that
had a central theme, contianed characters that flocked, followed another character, and had a in general all
worked together to make a complete scene. My project is a weird theme park, with googly eye gusy wandering around
following their skeleton leader and being chased by other types of guys. The chaser guys will also chase the player.
